GAME MECHANICS RULES
Variables:
    Court length- 40 meters
    Goal area- 6 meters on each side

0. For each player, draw an offensive contribuition and a defensive contribution, sum to make total team offense
and defense for the game (weighted average for amount of time played). Before the game starts, generate a very large
list of numpy randoms, to be referenced throughout the game. Regenerate if needed.

1. Opening posession determined 50-50, ball starts at the 20

2. When a team has the ball: offense / (offense + defense) = completed pass %, an incomplete pass will lead to either a turnover 
or a loss of meters (could be 0)

3. If a pass is completed, distance travelled is normally distributed, pull distance from ~N(4, 1.5) for now, but should scale 
depending on how much better the offense is than defense. Time spent will correlate with distance travelled.

4. When the ball is within shooting range, passes become shorter. 

5. At any point, a player may feasibly take a shot. At the 6 meter, they have a 50% chance of shooting, their probability
is expressed as a sigmoid function of distance from the 6 meter line, being effectively 100% at the 0 meter (goal)

6. distance, goalie, offense 

6. If a  shot is taken, a shot on goal will occur with probability e^-k*(distance from goal)

7. If a shot is on goal, a goal will occur with probability offense / (offense + m*defense + n*goalie)

8. If a shot does not turn into a goal, 10% chance of offensive rebound

9. At the end of the game, final score will have been tabulated. Points will be given to individual players
consistent with their offensive contribution to the team.
